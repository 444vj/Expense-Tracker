# MERN Stack Expense Tracker

This project is a full-stack expense tracker application designed to empower you with comprehensive cash flow monitoring. It leverages the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) to provide a user-friendly and feature-rich experience.

### Features:

 Intuitive Interface: The React-powered frontend offers a streamlined user experience for entering, categorizing, and visualizing your expenses.
 Data Persistence: The Express.js backend API ensures secure and scalable storage of your financial data in a MongoDB database.
 Robust Testing: Rigorous testing with Postman guarantees the reliability and functionality of the API and the overall application.

### Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
   - A MongoDB database running locally or in the cloud.

2. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-url.git
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd your-project-directory
   npm install (or yarn install)
   ```

4. **Configure Database Connection:**

   - Create a `.env` file in the project root directory (if it doesn't exist).
   - Add your MongoDB connection string to the `.env` file with the following format:

     ```
     MONGODB_URI=mongodb://your-mongodb-host:port/your-database-name
     ```

     Replace the placeholders with your actual database connection details.

5. **Start the Application:**

   ```bash
   npm start (or yarn start)
   ```

   This will typically start the development server, allowing you to access the application in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:3000` or a similar address).
